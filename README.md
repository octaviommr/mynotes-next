# MyNotes (Next.js version)

A very simple full-stack note board application, written for sandboxing and demonstration purposes. It showcases the Next.js framework, specially the front-end features, since front-end development is my main area of interest and one I'm passionate about. Below is a breakdown of the most relevant application features:

## Front-end

- TypeScript code for static type checking
- State management using Context API and reducers
- Tailwind CSS styling (with Headless UI and Heroicons)
- Accessibility using ARIA roles and attributes, and by ensuring color contrast
- Streaming using "loading.tsx" files, leveraging React Suspense
- Graceful error handling
- (TODO: metadata features)

## Back-end

- MongoDB database
- Data modelling and validation using mongoose
- Data mutation using React Server Actions
- Authentication features using the "next-auth" package of Auth.js and Next.js middleware
- Graceful error handling

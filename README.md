# MyNotes (Next.js version)

A very simple note board application, written for sandboxing and demonstration purposes. It showcases the Next.js framework, specially the front-end bit which is my main area of interest and the one I'm passionate about. Below is a breakdown of the most relevant application features:

## Front-end

- TypeScript code for static type checking
- State management using Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS styling (with Headless UI and Heroicons)
- Accessibility using ARIA roles and attributes and ensuring color contrast
- Global error handling

## Back-end

- MongoDB database
- Data modelling and validation using Mongoose
